# Think-And-Conquer
ThinkAndConquer is a turn-based strategy game inspired by Risiko, where players compete to conquer the world by answering trivia questions. Developed entirely in Java as my first experience with the language, the project features a custom graphical interface built using Swing and AWT. Players start with randomly assigned territories and troops, each linked to specific trivia categories such as History, Science, Sports, and more. The goal is to earn points by conquering territories and controlling continents, with victory achieved either by reaching a target score or by eliminating all opponents. Combat is resolved through quizzes of varying difficulty, allowing players to choose how challenging each question should be in order to maximize their score in duels. The entire game logic — including procedural setup, scoring system, and turn-based mechanics — was implemented from scratch. This project helped me understand and apply object-oriented programming concepts, manage interactive game states, and design a complete standalone application without external libraries.
