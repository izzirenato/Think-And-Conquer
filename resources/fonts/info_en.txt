GAME RULES
Objective:
Conquer territories by correctly answering trivia questions to reach the maximum score or eliminate all opponents


INITIAL SETUP
- Each player receives 3 random territories from their assigned spawn continent
- Each territory starts with 1 random troop
- Each player receives 2 additional random troops to deploy


POINTS TO WIN
- 2 players: 3600 points
- 3 players: 3200 points
- 4 players: 2800 points


SCORING SYSTEM
- +100 points for each territory conquered
- +200 points for each continent controlled in his entirety
- Obviously, if you don't control any territory, you have lost


GAME TURN
- Reinforcements: Every round you receive troops (points รท 200, minimum 1)
- Deployment: Place troops on your territories
- Actions: Attack or move troops (each troop can act only once per turn)
- End turn: Pass to next player


TROOP TYPES
Each troop type specializes in a question category:
- Archer: Art and Literature
- Barbarian: History and Geography
- Dragon: Cinema and Music
- Horse: Sport
- Wizard: Science


COMBAT
You have two Scenarios:
- Attack on Defended Enemy Territory - DUEL
	Face the defender in a multiple question challenge
	Number of questions equals total troops involved in the duel
	Each question matches the troop type: attacking with 2 Horses and 3 Dragons means 2 Sports questions and 3 Movies & Music questions
	Difficulty choice: Each player chooses difficulty for each of their questions:

	- Too Easy -> 100 points
	- Easy -> 200 points
	- Medium -> 300 points
	- Hard -> 400 points
	- Impossible -> 500 points

	Winner has the highest total score


- Attack on Undefended Territory
	Answer one single question
	Difficulty is preset based on total attacking troop count:

	- 1-2 troops: Medium
	- 3-4 troops: Easy
	- 5+ troops: Too Easy

	In this case, the category is determined by the most common attacking troop type



BATTLE LOSSES
In the case of a Duel, troops can be lost:

- 0-0 tie: Both players lose all troops, defender keeps control of the territory
- Other ties: Both reduced to the smaller original troop count, defender loses the territory
- Attacker wins: Attacker takes control of the territory
- Defender wins: Defender keeps control of the territory

In the case of a victory, all troops of the loser die, while the winner loses troops based on the victory margin  
Special case: If the loser scored 0 points, the winner keeps all troops  
Troop elimination: Eliminated troops are randomly discarded from original groups



HOW TO WIN
Win when you:
- Reach the maximum score
- Are the last player standing


HAVE A GOOD MATCH, SOLDIER
